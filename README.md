FMDP
====

I create my fmD Picture File structure. I just say this :)
I am using 3rd party module name is - PIL (Python Image Library 1.1.4)


My file structure

Start ``fmdp{``, comment line is similar to python ``#comment line`` and, ``[x,y]hexColour.colourIsAlpha;`` and last close fmdp file tag is ``}``

My file is very source code, I think for can using developers, so I don't know.



Bye bye.
